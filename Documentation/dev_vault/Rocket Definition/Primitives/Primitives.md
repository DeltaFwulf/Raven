Primitives are the building blocks of modules, and allow the vehicle's kinematics to be determined in a detailed and modular fashion. Primitives have a shape, material, and position relative to its parent module's origin. 


### List of Predefined Primitives:

[[Conic Full]]
[[Conic Generalised]]
[[Rectangular Prism]]

### Custom Primitives

If you desire a very specific shape to be included (complex geometry from a CAD model, etc), you can calculate the geometry's properties and create a new class by inheriting the Shape class in Python.
