$$
 I_{yy} = I_{zz} = \frac{\pi\rho}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}k^2x^5 + (2R_0k - \frac{1}{2}R_0 - \frac{3}{2}k^2x_0)x^4 + (R_0^2 - 2R_0kx_0 + k^2x_0^2)x^3\right)

+ \frac{\pi\rho}{20k}\left[(R_0 + k(x-x_0))^5\right]_{x_0}^{x_f}
$$

where
$$ k = \frac{R_f - R_0}{x_f - x_0}$$

let's compare our answer to that of a cone with R0 = 0 and Rf = 1, (xf - x0) = 1 and so x0 = -3/4 and xf = 1/4, with rho = 1:

We should expect the moment of inertia of a cone to equal
